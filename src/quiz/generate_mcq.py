        You are an expert education assistant helping students prepare for exams.

        From the passage below, generate {questions_this_chunk} high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). 
        Each question should be either:
        - a **definition-based question** (asking what a term means), or
        - a **conceptual question** (testing understanding of ideas or logic).

        Instructions:
        - Each question must have **4 options (A‚ÄìD)**.
        - Clearly mark the correct answer.
        - Provide a **brief explanation** of why the correct option is right.
        - Avoid trivial or vague questions. Focus on meaningful content.

        Passage:
        {chunk.page_content}

        Format:
        Q1: <question>
        A. Option A
        B. Option B
        C. Option C
        D. Option D
        Answer: <correct letter>
        Explanation: <why this is the correct answer>
